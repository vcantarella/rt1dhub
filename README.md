The Repositort is to sytematically develop and compare different models for reactive transport in groundwater problems. The models are developed initially in Python and Julia under different frameworks and will be compared using the same set of problems. The models will be compared in terms of accuracy, efficiency and ease of use.

The idea is to evaluate how to build numerical models under new paradigms for the solution of the equations and the consideration of optimization of run times, development time, code readability. Particular care is taken with respect of fitting the model to data. Tradiotionally models are fit using finite-difference approximation to derivatives. Now different technologies are available to derive the derivatives, which will be explored in this project.
